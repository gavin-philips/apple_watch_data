Here are some introductory materials to access and manipulate data using Rune's API. Full API documentation can be found at: https://rune-labs.quip.com/O04sAHmIkRA6/Rune-Stream-API-v1-Patient-Side-Access  

First, set up your analysis environment in Python. Then, download/clone this repository and load up the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook. 

* `00_python_installation_instructions` walks through setting up a Python analysis environment on a Mac.

* `01_download_and_save` walks through a simple example of pulling raw time series and spectrogram data and saving those as CSV files.

* `02_filter_by_meta_data` uses meta data such as stimulation, sensing, and adaptive parameters for advanced data querying.
